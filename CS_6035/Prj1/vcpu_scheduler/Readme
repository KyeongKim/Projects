## How to compile
1. Unzip the 'prj1_kkim651.zip'
        * unzip prj1_kkim651.zip
2. To compile and execute:
        1) cd vcpu_scheduler directory
        2) type 'make'
        3) To run, 'vcpu_scheduler <time interval>'

## Code Description
* It will first connect to the hypervisor.
* Once the connection to the hypervisor is established, it will get into an infinite loop,
which runs as long as there are active domains and is not interrupted by the user. 
* The logic is that it gets each guest machine's vCpu utilization and see if it is in a balanced
state by comparing the differences between the busiest and the freest. If the difference is within
the allowable threshold, then, it is considered a balanced status. If not, it gets into an algorithm
where it tries to find a balance among those set of numbers (each guest machine's vCpu utilization) and
find the best matches that would produce the total values as close as the average if numbers are
distributed to the number of bins (total number of pCPUs). Then, pin those changes.
